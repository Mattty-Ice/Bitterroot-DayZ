Hello!

Attached are the vanilla Missions Files for the Bitterroot DayZ map. All you will need to do is download the ZIP and then upload into your mpmissions folder wherever you are hositng your server. 

Bitterroot is a map that features several overhauls including buildings, weeapons and more. Many of the files have had vanilla items changed or removed entirely. You will find the removed items down at the very bottom of each file for your convenience if you wish to readd them. 

You can find High Definition sat map and tier map of Bitterroot here.
